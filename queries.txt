FROM film_category fc 
JOIN category c

JOIN    film f
ON       fc.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN    inventory i
ON       i.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN    rental r
ON        i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id

each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:
Category,Rental length category and Count

SELECT category, standard_quartile, COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT c.name category, f.rental_duration, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
     FROM category c , film_category fc , film f
     WHERE c.category_id = fc.category_id
     AND fc.film_id = f.film_id
     AND c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')) AS standard_quartile 
GROUP BY category, standard_quartile
ORDER BY category, standard_quartile;
