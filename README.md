# Investigate-a-Relational-Database

Investigate a Relational Database - The Sakila Database (The first project from Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python)

The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I queried data from the database to gain an understanding of the customer base.

In this project, I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals.
